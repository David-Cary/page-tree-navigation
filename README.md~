# Page Tree Navigation
This provides support for navigating through a collection of pages with their own nested subpages.  This includes support for tables of content, breadcrumb trails, page searches, and next/previous navigation through such trees.

# Quickstart
## Installation
You can install this library though npm like so:
```
$ npm install --save page-tree-navigation
```

Note that this takes advantage of the [key-crawler] library for a lot of it's traversal functionality.

## Content Trees
Many utility classes in this library take advantage of the `ContentNode` generic class.  Each such node consists of a typed content property and a children property for their child nodes.

`PageTreeNode` builds further on this by attaching the following properties to such nodes:
  * id: A unique identifier for the node within the node tree.
  * localName: An identifier that should be unique within the context of an ancestor with it's own local name or id.
  * title: A name/description for the page meant to be displayed to users.
